# Wildfire Mapping and Analysis in Alberta

## Overview

This project maps wildfire occurrences in Alberta using **NASA Natural Hazards datasets** and additional historical wildfire data.  
It visualizes the **geographic distribution** of wildfires over time and analyzes patterns to identify key factors driving wildfire frequency and burned areas.  
The goal is to propose innovative solutions for better wildfire preparation, response, and recovery in affected communities.
